                <p>Sometimes movies are more complicated than four-volume novels.
                    But you learn to read books in school, but you don't learn to watch movies.
                    And without preparation, it can be difficult to enjoy watching a movie.</p>
                <p>
                    In this 8-session course we will learn how to be conscious viewers.
                    We will get acquainted with the stages of film production and learn how to watch a movie through
                    the eyes of a screenwriter, director and editor. We will understand genres and look at the most
                    important
                    films, from Citizen Kane to The Matrix.</p>
